Snake Game
===========

This is a game I made for enternainment and learning purposes, learning C++ and game making, but also being very fun to develop.
This is the result.

## Compiling and Running
Run the following code to build the game:
```
mkdir build
cmake --build build
```

Now all you have to do is run the binary:
```
./build/snake
```
